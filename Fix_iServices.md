Fix for iServices (Messages, FaceTime, and the App Store)
1. Log in to your Apple Account using Ethernet (as before).
2. Ensure your Ethernet cable is disconnected before applying the iServices fix.
3. After applying the fix, plug in the Ethernet cable.
- **Note:** The only service not working is Handoff (AirDrop, Sidecar, etc)
